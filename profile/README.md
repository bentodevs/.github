Here you can find all the components which make Bento work...

- [Bento](https://github.com/bentodevs/bento) is the actual Discord Bot. Bento is written in Typescript, and uses the Discord.JS library to interact with Discord's APIs and Websocket gateways.
- Our [Docs](https://github.com/bentodevs/docs) repository contains all the required markdown files & GitHub Actions tooling to run the [Retype-powered Docs Site](https://docs.bento-bot.com). The docs are hosted with GitHub Pages, and the generated HTML files are published under the `retype` branch.
- [Ricebox](https://github.com/bentodevs/ricebox) is the API which powers some of Bento's commands. It is currently closed-source, but will be open-sourced in the future
